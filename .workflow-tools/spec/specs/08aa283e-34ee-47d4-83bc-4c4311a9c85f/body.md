# Summary

Ticket discovery is split across several partial query mechanisms with
inconsistent ordering. This spec defines one canonical, expressive query and
ordering contract for ticket discovery so that the shared `memory-api` query
layer, `ticket-api` workflow surfaces, and the CLI / MCP / HTTP adapters speak
a single query language instead of inventing per-surface filter flags.

The contract is intentionally close to a Rust iterator / pipeline mental model:
**select first, then order, then truncate**. Selection narrows the candidate
set; ordering arranges the surviving candidates; an optional limit truncates the
ordered stream. Every stage has deterministic, fully specified behavior.

This spec owns the *query language and ordering composition* contract. It does
**not** redefine the workflow ranking already specified by the best-next and
blocker-tree specs; it defines how caller-supplied ordering composes with that
existing workflow ranking, and where workflow ranking stays authoritative.

## Goals

- Define one canonical query AST and surface-independent grammar for ticket
  discovery.
- Specify the full operator set: logical combinators, comparison operators,
  deep-field path addressing, text search, and existence / null handling.
- Specify explicit ordering: order keys, direction, multi-key lexicographic
  chaining, and deterministic tie-breaks.
- Specify exactly how explicit ordering composes with the existing workflow
  ranking on `next` and `board` surfaces, and where workflow ranking remains
  authoritative.
- Define a transport-safe representation so CLI, MCP, and HTTP express the same
  query without divergent field names.
- Provide a validation matrix spanning parser, storage/search evaluation,
  adapter parity, and workflow-surface regression.

## Non-Goals

- Redefining the workflow convergence ranking comparator. That is owned by
  `ticket-api/workflow/best-next-ordering` and
  `ticket-api/workflow/blocker-trees-and-recently-unblocked-ordering`.
- Changing board-aware exclusion / WIP semantics.
- Introducing a new persistence format or a second search index.
- SQL-like joins across tickets. The query model addresses a single ticket's
  fields and its derived workflow facts only.

## Current State

- `memory-api` query AST (`Expr`) already supports `And`, `Or`, `Not`, `Fts`,
  and `Field { key, value }` where `value` is `ValueExpr::Text` or
  `ValueExpr::Range { start, end }`.
- The shared parser supports space-separated `AND`, `OR` groups, dash-prefixed
  `NOT`, quoted phrases, bare full-text tokens, `key:value` field predicates,
  and `[start TO end]` ranges. Strict mode validates known fields and the
  `x_<type>_<field>` dynamic namespace.
- Tantivy translation in `storage/search.rs` maps `And`/`Or`/`Not`/`Fts`/`Field`
  to boolean queries, but `ValueExpr::Range` currently degrades to `AllQuery`
  (range is parsed but not evaluated), and only `state`, `type`, `id`, `title`
  map to indexed fields.
- `ticket list --where key=value` supports only repeated equality filters.
- `ticket next` / `board show` apply workflow convergence ranking and have no
  caller-specified ordering.

This spec extends that foundation with comparison operators, deep-field
addressing, evaluated ranges, and an explicit ordering clause.

## Query Model

### Pipeline semantics

A ticket query is evaluated as a pipeline:

1. **Scope** — surface-specific candidate set (e.g. all tickets for `list`,
   actionable tickets for `next`, a subgraph for tree surfaces).
2. **Select** — apply the boolean predicate tree to retain matching tickets.
3. **Order** — arrange survivors by the effective order keys (see Ordering).
4. **Limit** — truncate to `limit` if supplied.

Selection never reorders; ordering never filters; limit never reorders. A
ticket either matches the predicate or it does not — partial matches do not
exist.

### Predicate AST

The canonical AST is an extension of the existing `Expr`:

```
Expr ::= And(Vec<Expr>)
       | Or(Vec<Expr>)
       | Not(Box<Expr>)
       | Fts(String)
       | Field { path: FieldPath, op: CompareOp, value: ValueExpr }

CompareOp ::= Eq | Contains | Gt | Gte | Lt | Lte | Range | Exists
ValueExpr ::= Text(String) | Range { start, end } | Empty   // Empty used by Exists
```

`Field.key` is generalized to `FieldPath` (see Deep Fields). The existing
`Expr::Field { key, value }` shape is preserved as the `Eq` case so prior
parser output and tests remain valid; new operators add variants rather than
replacing the equality form.

### Logical combinators

- `and` — implicit between space-separated terms; all sub-expressions must
  match. Empty `And` matches every ticket (identity).
- `or` — the `OR` keyword (case-insensitive) separates disjunction groups; at
  least one group must match. Each group is itself an implicit `And`. `OR` must
  separate two non-empty expressions.
- `not` — a leading `-` on a term, or the explicit `NOT`/`not` keyword,
  negates the immediately following term. `not` over a non-matching ticket
  yields a match; `not` over an absent field follows the existence rules below.
- Precedence: `not` binds tightest, then implicit `and`, then `or` (lowest).
  Parentheses are **not** required for the supported surfaces; disjunction is
  expressed at the top level via `OR` groups. If grouped parentheses are later
  added, they bind tighter than `or` and looser than a single term.

### Comparison operators

Field predicates use `key<op>value` token forms. The canonical operator tokens
and their `key:value`-compatible spellings are:

| Operator | Token form        | Meaning                                             |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `Eq`     | `key:value`       | Exact (case-insensitive for enum/string fields).    |
| `Contains` | `key:~value` or `key:*value*` | Substring match on the field's text value. |
| `Gt`     | `key:>value`      | Strictly greater than.                              |
| `Gte`    | `key:>=value`     | Greater than or equal.                              |
| `Lt`     | `key:<value`      | Strictly less than.                                 |
| `Lte`    | `key:<=value`     | Less than or equal.                                 |
| `Range`  | `key:[a TO b]`    | Inclusive range `a <= field <= b`.                  |
| `Exists` | `key:?`           | Field is present and non-empty.                     |

- The canonical token form for `Contains` is `key:~value`. `key:*value*` is an
  accepted alias. `~` was chosen so substring stays distinct from the existing
  full-text `Fts` clause.
- Comparison ordering for a field is determined by its declared type:
  - **temporal** fields (`created_at`, `became_actionable_at`,
    `last_blocker_progress_at`, dynamic `x_*` date fields): compared as RFC3339
    timestamps, chronologically.
  - **numeric** fields (effort/token budget, `dependee_count`, dynamic numeric
    `x_*` fields): compared numerically.
  - **ordinal enum** fields (`state` via schema state index, `priority` via the
    `critical > high > medium > low > none` order): compared by their declared
    rank, not lexically.
  - **string** fields: compared by case-insensitive lexicographic order.
- A comparison against a value that cannot be parsed for the field's type is a
  query error with a deterministic message, not a silent no-match.

### Text search

- A bare token (or quoted phrase) is an `Fts` clause: full-text + substring
  search over title and body (plus id substring), matching current behavior.
- `Fts` is distinct from `Contains`: `Fts` searches indexed text fields and
  tokenizes; `Contains` is a substring predicate on one named field's raw
  value.
- Quoted phrases preserve spaces and are matched as a phrase.

### Deep fields and field paths

- A `FieldPath` is one or more dot-separated segments: `segment(.segment)*`.
- The first segment selects a top-level addressable field or a dynamic
  namespace root.
- **Dynamic / structured metadata** uses the existing `x_<type>_<field>`
  namespace as the canonical flat form. Dotted addressing `x.<type>.<field>` is
  an accepted equivalent that normalizes to the same flat key, so storage and
  index keys stay stable.
- Unknown top-level fields fail in strict mode with the existing deterministic
  hint pointing at known fields and the dynamic namespace.
- Deep paths that address a missing intermediate segment are treated as a
  missing field (see Null Handling), never a parse error, once the leading
  segment is a valid namespace.

### Null / missing-field handling

- `key:value` (`Eq`) against a missing field does **not** match.
- `key:?` (`Exists`) matches only when the field is present and non-empty.
- `-key:?` / `not key:?` matches tickets where the field is absent or empty.
- Comparison operators (`>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, range) against a missing field do
  **not** match (a missing value is neither greater nor less than anything).
- `Not` over a predicate matches every ticket for which the inner predicate
  does not match, including tickets missing the field — except `not key:?`,
  which is the canonical "field absent" form described above.

## Ordering

### Explicit order clause

- An explicit order is a sequence of order keys: `order:field[:dir]` repeated,
  or a comma list `order:f1:asc,f2:desc`.
- `dir` is `asc` or `desc`; default is `asc` for string/temporal/numeric and
  ascending-by-rank for ordinal enums (lowest rank first) unless `desc`.
- Multi-key ordering composes **lexicographically**: tickets are compared by the
  first key; ties fall through to the second key; and so on. This mirrors Rust's
  tuple `Ord` / chained `then_with`.
- Comparison per key uses the same field type rules as the comparison operators
  (temporal, numeric, ordinal enum, string).
- The final, always-applied deterministic tie-break is ticket `id`, ensuring a
  stable total order even when all user keys tie.

### Default ordering per surface

- `list`: when no explicit order is given, default ordering is ascending effort
  (token budget), preserving today's behavior, then the `id` tie-break.
- `search`: default ordering is relevance score descending, then `id`.
- `next` and `board` recommendations: default ordering is the **workflow
  ranking comparator** owned by `best-next-ordering` /
  `blocker-trees-and-recently-unblocked-ordering`. This spec does not change
  those keys.

### Composition of explicit order with workflow ranking

The key design decision this spec locks:

- On **non-workflow surfaces** (`list`, `search`), an explicit order clause is
  fully authoritative and replaces the default ordering. Workflow ranking is not
  involved.
- On **workflow surfaces** (`next`, `board` recommendations, MCP `next_tickets`,
  and any HTTP workflow-next surface):
  - The default remains the workflow comparator.
  - An explicit order clause is treated as a **secondary refinement that runs
    after** the workflow comparator: candidates are first ordered by the
    authoritative workflow comparator, and the explicit keys act only as
    additional tie-breakers *before* the final `id` tie-break.
  - Callers cannot use explicit ordering to override convergence-pressure
    ranking on workflow surfaces; doing so would silently defeat the dependency
    contract. If a caller needs to fully reorder actionable tickets by a raw
    field, they should query the `list` surface scoped to actionable state
    instead.
- The selection (predicate) part of the query is always fully honored on every
  surface; only the *ordering* portion is constrained on workflow surfaces.

This keeps the system dependency-first where that is the contract, while still
letting callers add deterministic secondary ordering and use the full
expressive predicate language everywhere.

## Transport-Safe Representation

The same query must be expressible across CLI, MCP, and HTTP without each
adapter inventing field names.

- **Canonical string form**: the surface-independent grammar above
  (`key:op value`, `OR`, `-`, `order:f:dir`, `[a TO b]`). Every adapter MUST
  accept this string form for the query and the order clause.
- **CLI**: `--query "<canonical string>"` is the primary surface. The legacy
  `--where key=value` repeated flag remains an equality-only shorthand that
  lowers into `And(Field{Eq})` for backward compatibility. `--order f:dir`
  repeatable or `--order f1:asc,f2:desc`.
- **MCP**: a single `query` string field plus an optional `order` string field
  on ticket query / workflow request types. No per-operator structured fields;
  the string grammar is the contract.
- **HTTP**: a `q` (or `query`) query-string parameter carrying the canonical
  string, plus an optional `order` parameter. Range and comparison tokens must
  be URL-safe; adapters are responsible for standard percent-decoding before
  parsing.
- Field names in the query are the canonical field keys (e.g. `state`,
  `priority`, `created_at`, `x_<type>_<field>`); adapters MUST NOT expose
  aliases that are not defined here.

## Validation Matrix

| Layer | What is validated | Example evidence |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| Parser | Combinators, comparison tokens, deep-field paths, ranges, existence, error messages | `cargo test -p ticket-cli --test contracts_query_parser` |
| Storage / search | Tantivy translation of each operator incl. evaluated ranges, comparisons, deep fields, null handling | `cargo test -p memory-api search` / storage eval tests |
| Ordering | Multi-key lexicographic order, direction, type-aware comparison, `id` tie-break | `cargo test -p ticket-cli` ordering tests |
| Adapter parity | Same canonical string yields same result set + order via CLI, MCP, HTTP | `cargo test -p ticket-cli`, `cargo test -p ticket-mcp`, `cargo test -p ticket-http` |
| Workflow composition | Explicit order refines but does not override workflow comparator on `next`/`board`; predicate fully honored | `cargo test -p ticket-cli` next/board regression |

## Acceptance Criteria

- The spec names every supported logical operator, comparison operator,
  deep-field path rule, text-search behavior, and null/existence rule.
- The spec defines explicit ordering semantics (keys, direction, lexicographic
  multi-key chaining, deterministic `id` tie-break) and how they compose with
  the existing workflow ranking, including which surfaces keep workflow ranking
  authoritative.
- The spec identifies which existing surfaces reuse the shared query model
  (`list`, `search`, `next`, `board`, MCP, HTTP) versus which retain
  specialized default ordering (workflow surfaces).
- The spec defines the transport-safe canonical string form and per-adapter
  representation so CLI, MCP, and HTTP express the same query without divergent
  field names.
- The spec includes a validation matrix spanning parser, storage/search,
  adapter parity, and workflow-surface regression.
