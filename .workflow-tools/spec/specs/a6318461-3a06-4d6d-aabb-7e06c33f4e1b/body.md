# Summary

`audit-api` should flag orphan tickets so every active ticket participates
in the repository's `depends_on` graph.

## Required behavior

- When `audit run` targets a repository with a local `.ticket` store, the
	audit loads tickets and edges through `ticket-api` and evaluates ticket
	topology as an additional trial.
- Only `depends_on` edges satisfy this rule. A ticket is considered linked when
	it has at least one outgoing `depends_on` dependency or at least one incoming
	dependee.
- Any active ticket with neither dependencies nor dependees produces an
	audit finding with the ticket folder path, ticket id, state, and the observed
	edge counts.
- Findings must guide the user toward either linking the ticket to its real
	prerequisites or creating a project-tracker parent ticket that depends on the
	otherwise standalone task.
- Repositories without a local `.ticket` store must not hard-fail the entire
	audit. The ticket-topology metric should report as unavailable instead.

## Acceptance criteria

- A repository with one orphan ticket and one linked ticket pair reports a
	single orphan-ticket finding.
- A repository where every ticket participates in at least one `depends_on`
	relationship reports zero orphan-ticket findings.
- A repository without a `.ticket` store keeps the audit runnable and marks the
	ticket-topology metric unavailable.
- The public audit spec records ticket-topology validation as part of the audit
	trial set.
