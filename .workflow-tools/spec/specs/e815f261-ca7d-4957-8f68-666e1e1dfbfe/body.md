# Summary

`rule-api` already supports canonical rule storage in `.rule/rules/**`, repo-scoped filtering, hierarchical target outlines, and deterministic generation from a single `rule-targets.yaml`. The next step is to make rule workspaces first-class at nested repo boundaries so each submodule repository can own its local rules while parent repositories can compose child rules into parent targets.

# Summary

`rule-api` already supports canonical rule storage in `.rule/rules/**`, repo-scoped filtering, hierarchical target outlines, and deterministic generation from a single `rule-targets.yaml`. The next step is to make rule workspaces first-class at nested repo boundaries so each submodule repository can own its local rules while parent repositories can compose child rules into parent targets.

This spec is about workspace topology and composition. The rule-folder storage contract, canonical `body.md` body asset, and compatibility behavior for legacy `description.md` rule folders are defined separately in `rule-api/store`.

## Repositories In Scope

- `memory-viewers/`
- `memory-api/`
- `viewer-api/`

## Problem

Today the active rule workflow is effectively single-workspace:

- one `.rule/` store root
- one `rule-targets.yaml` per generation run
- one `RuleStore::open(index_root)` call per CLI or MCP invocation

That works for the top-level `context-engine` workspace, but it does not let nested repositories carry their own local rule workspace, local targets, or local authoring workflow without routing everything back through the parent repository.

## User Stories

### memory-viewers maintainer

As the maintainer of `memory-viewers/`, I need a repo-local rule workspace that can generate parent-level docs while reusing rules authored inside child repos such as `memory-api/` and `viewer-api/`.

### memory-api maintainer

As the maintainer of `memory-api/`, I need a repo-local rule workspace so README content, usage guides, and subsystem guidance can be authored beside the code they describe instead of in the parent repo.

### viewer-api maintainer

As the maintainer of `viewer-api/`, I need a repo-local rule workspace so viewer-specific guidance can evolve independently and still participate in parent-level documentation when needed.

## Proposed Workspace Model

Each in-scope repository should support the same local rule workspace shape:

- `.rule/rules/<uuid>/rule.toml`
- `.rule/rules/<uuid>/body.md`
- optional repo-local generated target config in `rule-targets.yaml`

`rule-api/store` owns the folder-internal storage rules for rule metadata, body hydration, and legacy compatibility. This spec only defines how those rule folders are distributed across nested repositories and composed into parent or child generation flows.

Each generated target config may be expressed as a nested file/folder tree that mirrors runtime output paths:

- root-level `files:` entries for outputs in the repo root
- nested `folders:` entries for runtime directories such as `.github/`, `.agents/`, or `tools/`
- one file node per generated artifact, with the target definition attached to that file node

When a generated target overwrites an existing tracked file, the generator should
preserve that file's current newline convention instead of rewriting it to a
different line-ending style. Newly created outputs may continue to use the
canonical LF rendering.

This structure is intended to keep large target inventories manageable by grouping outputs by domain and file type without changing target names or rendered destinations.

A parent repo workspace may aggregate child workspaces discovered in nested submodule or subfolder roots, but local authoring remains owned by the repo that contains the rule entry.

## Usage Guide

1. Author or update local rules from the repo that owns the documentation concern.
2. Organize `rule-targets.yaml` as a file/folder tree ordered by runtime output structure, domain, and file type when the repo owns many generated artifacts.
3. Preview composition with `rule explain-target --config rule-targets.yaml --target <name>`.
4. Regenerate repo-local outputs with `rule sync-targets --config rule-targets.yaml`.
5. From a parent workspace, generate parent outputs that intentionally include descendant rules where the target configuration calls for them.

## Non-Goals

- Replacing the existing top-level `context-engine/.rule` workflow immediately.
- Allowing parent repos to mutate child rule entries in place.
- Hiding rule provenance when multiple workspaces contribute to one target.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The nested rule workspace topology is documented for `memory-viewers`, `memory-api`, and `viewer-api`.
- The target configuration model documents the file/folder tree layout used to keep generated outputs grouped by domain and file type.
- User stories and local authoring flows are defined for each repo.
- Child implementation specs can build on this spec without redefining repository ownership or workflow vocabulary.
- The final implementation must preserve deterministic target generation and explicit rule provenance.
- Re-running target generation must not introduce byte-only diffs solely from newline normalization when an output file already exists.
